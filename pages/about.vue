    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <article>
      Growing up I always wanted to know how things worked. Initially this
      manifested relating to electronics, and later biology, specifically
      molecular biology. <br />
      While breaking through the barrier of what is known, and contributing to a
      highly specific topic during my PhD I came to enjoy the analytical side:
      processing, transforming then ultimately visualising data in an easily
      digestible format. Now, I am embarking on a journey of Data Analysis and
      Data Science; ever learning and enjoying the process along the way.
